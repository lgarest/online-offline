# ONLINE-OFFLINE

This project is just an example on how to manage online-offline connectivity
using the listeners provided by the document object and the navigator.online
boolean.


## How to run it

Just use to start a development server with the example.
```sh
yarn start
```

To keep things simple, I'm using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to handle the bundle with no hassle.
